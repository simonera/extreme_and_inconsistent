# Turning regressions inside out

This repository includes the data and R code to replicate the analysis in my article "Extreme and Inconsistent: A Case-Oriented Regression Analysis of Health, Inequality, and Poverty", written with [Ron Breiger](http://www.u.arizona.edu/~breiger/RLB/Welcome.html) and published in [Socius](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/2378023120906064). 

The repository includes:
- `2378023120906064.pdf`: the published manuscript.
- `extreme_and_inconsistent_code_including_data.r`: an R script to replicate the analysis.
- `extreme_and_inconsistent_supplemental_material.pdf`: supplemental material.

My [portfolio](https://www.simonerambotti.com/portfolio) also includes a [project](https://sites.google.com/view/simone-rambotti/portfolio/trio) to replicate the analysis using tidyverse packages (e.g., ggplot2).
